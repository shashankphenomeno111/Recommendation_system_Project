An end-to-end recommendation system that suggests relevant online courses to learners based on preferences, history, and engagement.

Online learning platforms face difficulty in helping learners discover the most suitable courses from large catalogs.

This project aims to build a Recommendation System that suggests courses to users based on:

✅ Engagement patterns
✅ Course characteristics

This solution improves user satisfaction and platform conversion rates.

✅ Problem Statement

✔ Collaborative Filtering
✔ Content-Based Filtering
✔ Hybrid Recommendation

The output is a ranked list of recommended courses for each user.
